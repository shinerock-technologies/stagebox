Perfect — using your actual UI screenshots is way smarter than wasting time in Figma for this kind of hero mock. Let’s make your landing-page shot look intentional, professional, and story-driven.

🎯 GOAL

We want the screenshot to feel alive — as if it’s mid-show or mid-production.
So each timer, message, and clock value should suggest a real-world use case, not random filler.

🕐 Clock

Keep the clock realistic but neutral — 10:14:36 AM or 2:45:20 PM are great.
They read cleanly, sit well visually (no big repeated numbers like 11:11), and fit both demo & production vibes.
→ Set it to: 10:14:36 AM America/New_York

⏱ Timer Names + Durations

Make them look like a real production or event sequence (e.g., a conference, rehearsal, or broadcast).
Keep durations visually balanced — around 5–15 minutes each.

Timer	Name	Duration	Notes
Timer 1	Opening Remarks	05:00	Short intro or setup
Timer 2	Keynote Presentation	15:00	Main event block
Timer 3	Panel Discussion	10:00	Interactive section
Timer 4	Audience Q&A	08:00	Optional Q&A slot
Timer 5	Break / Transition	05:00	Reset stage or gear
Timer 6	Closing Announcements	03:00	Wrap-up countdown

💡 Bonus detail: Have one of them “Paused” (like your current Timer 3) — it implies active use.

💬 Messages (Right Panel)

Messages should sound like real, short production cues — clear, direct, professional.

Message	Example
1	“Stage lights ready ✅”
2	“Switch to camera 2 in 10 seconds”
3	“Extend Q&A by 2 minutes”
4	“Mic 3 battery low ⚡”
5	“All clear — go for outro music 🎵”

💡 Tip: Have one “message” half-typed in the input box, like:

“Reminder: Next speaker in…”
It adds realism, like someone is mid-coordination.

🧠 Composition Tips

Make Timer 3 (Panel Discussion) highlighted — it looks active and draws the eye.

Keep “Paused” state visible — reinforces control & reliability.
